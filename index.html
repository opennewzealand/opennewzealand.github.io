          <p>We do things on the web that improve interactions between government and citizens.</p>

<p>Web technology enables better interactions between government and citizens. Government can inform, consult, and serve citizens better through the web. Citizens can use, check, and improve the services of their government through the web. Government departments can work better together through the web, reducing waste. Citizens can efficiently work together through the web, reducing the need for government services.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Don't get caught in the Open Data Trap â€” build things that make citizen's lives better."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use Open Data, not for its own end, but for apps for citizens.</p>

<p>We want to see a world where things citizens want are communicated clearly to government.</p>

<p>Where there are greater economic, social and cultural opportunities for citizens.</p>

<p>And where government operates more efficiently and transparently.</p>
