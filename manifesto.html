    <h3>From across New Zealand</h3>
    <p><i>Code for NZ</i> is a community that advocates transparency of information, also known as open data. We are passionate coders, designers, activists, educators, writers and citizens from across New Zealand. Through working together to bring data into the open, we hope to build a better New Zealand for its citizens. To join <i>Code for NZ</i>, all you need is to be ready and willing to use your expertise or energy for our cause.</p>
    <h3>Freedom of Speech &amp; Information Transparency</h3>
    <p>Built on the spirit of the open-source community, <i>Code for NZ</i> stands for freedom of speech and information transparency. We aim to use technology in the interest of the public good, allowing citizens easy access to vital information. Opening up and making data public allows the people of New Zealand to take a closer look at politics and important issues. This gives them the tools needed to evaluate their government and exert their democratic right to decide how politicians act.</p>
    <h3>Independent and Transparent</h3>
    <p>We cooperate through our slack channel, <a href="https://codefornz.slack.com">codefornz.slack.com</a>, and through open platforms such as github. Our work is also done through open events, such as our "hackathons". Everything we produce &mdash; source code, documents, formulas, analyses and processes &mdash; is made available for anyone to view, react to, use and improve.</p>
    <h3>If you're interested, Join us</h3>
    <p>Our community is grassroots: we are non-partisan, unbiased and not for sale. You can contribute to our hackathons with your skills, ideas, time or donations, or provide support for specific projects.</p>
